How the Browser Distinguishes Media Queries
The browser, not the server, is responsible for interpreting and applying @media rules. Here's how it works:

ðŸ“¦ 1. CSS is sent to the browser as-is
The server just delivers the CSS file â€” it doesnâ€™t evaluate or modify @media rules.
The browser reads the CSS and applies styles based on the current viewport width (and other media features like orientation, resolution, etc.).

ðŸ“± 2. Mobile vs Desktop is determined by width
Media Query	Applies When	Typical Use
- @media (max-width: 768px)	Viewport is 768px or narrower	Mobile & small tablets
- @media (min-width: 1024px)	Viewport is 1024px or wider	Desktop & large screens
So even though the syntax is the same, the condition inside the @media block tells the browser when to apply those styles.

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  /* Desktop-only styles */
}
